Java and JDBC connectivity

The Electronic Medical Records (EMR) System is a digital platform designed to manage 
patient health data efficiently, securely, and reliably. It facilitates the storage, retrieval, and 
updating of patient records, including personal details, medical history, diagnoses, 
treatments, and lab results. By leveraging object-oriented programming, multithreading, 
and database integration, the system ensures seamless concurrent access, error handling, 
and data integrity. 
This project implements core functionalities such as CRUD operations, file handling for 
backup, and advanced database features like triggers, stored procedures, and ACID
compliant transactions. Custom exceptions and a user-friendly interface enhance usability 
and robustness. The system supports healthcare providers by streamlining workflows, 
minimizing errors, and providing quick access to comprehensive patient data, thereby 
improving the quality of care and decision-making. 
This EMR System is an essential step toward modernizing healthcare, reducing reliance on 
paper records, and ensuring secure, scalable, and efficient data management.
